# BookNest

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

**BookNest**Â is a personal web tracker Iâ€™m currently working on. Initially, it started as a simple project to test out new technologies, but it has since evolved into a full-fledged book-tracking application. The project is still a work in progress, but itâ€™s coming along nicely!

## Features

- **Book Tracking**: Keep track of the books youâ€™re reading, including details like genre, author, and progress.

- **Charts and Analytics**: Visualize your reading habits with interactive charts powered byÂ **Recharts**.

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication usingÂ **Lucia Auth**.

- **Responsive Design**: Built withÂ **Tailwind CSS**Â for a clean and responsive UI.

- **Data Management**: UsesÂ **Prisma**Â as the ORM to manage database interactions.

- **Efficient Data Fetching**: UtilizesÂ **React Query**Â for efficient and optimized data fetching.
